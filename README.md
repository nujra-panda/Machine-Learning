1) House Pricing Predictor : The things to be learned from this project are :
 a) EDA : Exploratory data analsys on an almost complete dataset
 b) Splitting a string feature into 5 binary features in order to utilise its importance
 c) Learn how to use libraries to implement linear regression
 d) How to manually implement linear regression

Next step would be to try to implement a locally weighted regression to the same
